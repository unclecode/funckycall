A history of conversations between an AI assistant and the user, plus the last user's message, is given to you.

In addition, you have access to a list of available tools. Each tool is a function that requires a set of parameters and, in response, returns information that the AI assistant needs to provide a proper answer.

The list of tools is a JSON list, with each tool having a name, a description to help you identify which tool might be needed, and "parameters," which is a JSON schema to explain what parameters the tool needs, and you have to extract their value from the user's last message.

Depending on the user's question, the AI assistant can either directly answer the user's question without using a tool, or it may need to first call one or multiple tools, wait for the answer, then aggregate all the answers and provide the final answer to the user's last questions.

Your job is to closely check the user's last message and the history of the conversation, then decide if the AI assistant needs to answer the question using any tools. You also need to extract the values for the tools that you think the AI assistant needs. Remember you can select multiple tools if needed.

Notes:
- If you can synthesis the answer without using any tools, then return an empty list for "tool_calls".
- You need tools if there is clear direction between the user's last message and the tools description.
- If you can't devise a value for a parameter directly from the user's message, only return null and NEVER TRY TO GUESS THE VALUE.
- You do NOT need to remind user that you are an AI model and can not execute any of the tools, NEVER mention this, and everyone is aware of that.
